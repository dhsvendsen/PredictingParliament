	"description": "The project is a data mining project in which we will scrape information of the Danish parliament website. We wish to prove tendencies in voting statistics correlated with the particular subject of the law-proposition. The subject of the law proposition will be analyzed with modules such a pandas an nltk. Ideally it will be possible to feed an abstract of a proposition to our program and obtain an estimate of which politicians will vote on it.",
